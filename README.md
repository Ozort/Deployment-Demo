# 🚀 Automated Static Website Deployment (CI/CD)

This project demonstrates a simple **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** setup for a static website using **GitHub Actions** and **GitHub Pages**.

The goal of this project was to understand the fundamentals of DevOps, version control, and automated deployments in a beginner-friendly way.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- A basic static website built with **HTML**
- Source code hosted on **GitHub**
- Automatic deployment triggered on every push to the `main` branch
- Live site hosted using **GitHub Pages**

Whenever code is updated and pushed to GitHub, the website is automatically redeployed without any manual steps.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)
- **GitHub Pages** (Hosting)

---

## 🔁 CI/CD Workflow (Simple Explanation)

1. Code is pushed to the GitHub repository
2. GitHub Actions detects the change
3. The updated website is automatically deployed
4. The live site reflects the changes within seconds

This setup simulates a real-world CI/CD pipeline in a simplified way.

## ☁️ Note on AWS

This project originally began as an exploration of AWS CI/CD services (EC2 and CodeDeploy).  
Due to service limitations on the free tier and to keep the project beginner-friendly, the deployment was completed using **GitHub Actions** instead.

The experience helped reinforce an important DevOps lesson:
> Choosing the right tool for the task is just as important as understanding the tools themselves.
